Eventing
========

An eventing library for the Compact Framework that allows logic to be decoupled from the UI in Compact Framework forms projects. 

Save readmodels / projections by publishing events on the form and subscribe / handle the event in as many ways as you want. 

See the example project for usage. The implementation of the EventHandlerResolver is in the example project in case you want to implement this using an alternative IoC container.
